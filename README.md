# impro
Python tools for the analysis of collective (free) improvisation pieces.

In music, one way of describing data is by using point processes, for important events like interruptive generations (IG) points, or similar events which are by nature discrete in time.
This library provides tools to treat data/signals/processes which are of this peculiar form, in particular to probe their correlation.

The functions in this library have been used in the article [Cl√©ment Canonne and Nicolas B. Garnier
*Individual Decisions and Perceived Form in Collective Free Improvisation*, Journal of New Music Research 44 (2) pp145-167 (2015)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09298215.2015.1061564).
